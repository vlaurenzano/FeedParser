  <productName>Ella's kitchen mangoes &amp; papayas - </productName>
  <productDescription>Super smooth. I'm 100% organic. No added sugar, salt or water - I contain naturally occurring sugars. No additives or thickeners. No E numbers or GM. No wheat or dairy (gluten or lactose). No lumps or bits and nothing artificial. Just yummy organic food for babies. I'm suitable for vegetarians too. Mangoes, pears&amp;papayas. Hello, I'm 100% organic pureed fruit - with nothing else added, not even water. Who am I for? My ingredients are suitable from 4 months. I'm also great mixed into chopped protein, fruit or veg for babies and toddlers ready for chunkier food. The Government advises that you don't need to wean your little one until they are 6 months. Every baby is different! My dad made a promise to me and my brother that he would only use stuff in our products that is full of goodness. I told him everything also has to taste great and he agreed!

No refined sugars or fruit concentrates, flavourings or colours in me. I'm suitable for vegetarians too. Hello, I'm 100% whole milk ride pudding, real squished raspberry puree blend + a squeeze of agave nectar, with nothing else added. Did you know, agave nectar comes from a cactus plant for a naturally sweet taste? I'm just simple ingredients and I don't contain the tiniest smidge of any refined sugars, fruit concentrates, flavourings or colours. I contain naturally occurring sugars. Who am I for? I contain pasteurised milk, eggs + rice so my ingredients and texture are suitable from 7 months.

  <productName>Kiddylicious melts strawberry &amp; banana - </productName>
  <productDescription>1 of 5-a-day. 100% fruit. Crunchy, melty, bubbly bites. Suitable for 12 months+. No milk, lactose, nuts, seeds, wheat or gluten. No added preservatives, sugar or salt - contains naturally occurring sugars. Suitable for coeliacs, lactose intolerance and vegetarians. Over the years I have discovered a number of great tasting fruit based snacks (fruit crisps&amp;fruit wiggles) that are loved by my kids and judging by the feedback I regularly get, many other young children too. When I came across a solid smoothie, I though wow, what a great idea. Strawberries and bananas whizzed up to make them frothy, then set into crunchy, bubbly bites that melt as soon as you put them on your tongue - how cool is that! Each bag of Smoothie melts, equivalent to a portion of fruit for a child, is just 100% fruit with nothing else added. Perfect for home baking, toppings&amp;lunchboxes. See what you think as they dissolve in your mouth - just like a smoothie drink! Sally Preston. Have you tried our scrummy Fruit Crisps&amp;Fruit Wriggles? Made from the finest fruits, and providing at least 1 of the recommended 5 fruit or veg portions a day, they're simply fruit made fun!

  <productName>Kiddylicis apple fruit wriggles apple - </productName>
  <productDescription>1 of 5-a-day. They're all fruit with just a dusting of rice flour. No milk, lactose, nuts, seeds, wheat or gluten. No additives. No added preservatives, sugar or salt - contains naturally occurring sugars. Suitable for vegetarians, coeliacs&amp;lactose intolerance. As a mum, I am always looking for yummy snacks to feed my kids (Hanna&amp;Jack). When I discovered these Fruit Wriggles they loved them and so did I - a perfect fruity snack for any time of day. Made from juicy apples that are puréed then whizzed with more apple juice and pectin from lemons - that's it. Nothing else. Then they are magically made into wonderfully tasty wriggles that can be twisted or twiddled for great fun. Each bag is equivalent to a small apple and contributes to more than 1 of your 5 a day. Fantastic! Perfect for home baking, toppings&amp;lunchboxes. We hope you enjoy them too. Sally Preston. Have you tried our scrummy Fruit Crisps&amp;Smoothie Melts?
